BioSQL release v1.0.2 plans
---------------------------

This could be a small release adding an SQLite3 version of the schema,
which is already in the repository and supported by Biopython. What
remains to be done is updating the BioSQL Perl scripts (e.g. the
taxonomy loader) to support SQLite.

BioSQL release v1.0.1
---------------------

This is an update release of the v1.0 core BioSQL schema (code-named
Tokyo), not including recent extensions.

Note: open questions are in *italics.* If you have thoughts or feedback
on any of the below, please email them to biosql-l@lists.open-bio.org.

BioSQL release v1.0.0
---------------------

This is a release of the core BioSQL schema, not including recent
extensions.

Note: open questions are in *italics.* If you have thoughts or feedback
on any of the below, please email them to biosql-l@lists.open-bio.org.

1.  Update license for BioSQL and all its DDL and software scripts.
    *Done. This is now the LGPL license for all schema files.
    --[Hilmar](http://lappland.io) 20:23, 21 February 2008 (EST)*
    -   The current license refers to the 'same terms as Perl' and the
        Perl Artistic Licence. Not only does Perl now dual-license under
        Artistic License v2.0 or GPL (because the original Perl Artistic
        License v1.0 has problems), but also there isn't a good reason
        to tie the BioSQL license to that of Perl.

2.  Update, fix, or remove various ancillary files that don't seem to
    have been touched in a long time.
    -   biosql-accelerators-pg.sql *Updated/fixed, and now also retired.
        --[Hilmar](http://lappland.io) 23:40, 22 February
        2008 (EST)*
    -   biosqldb-views-pg.sql *Done. --[Hilmar](http://lappland.io)
        20:31, 21 February 2008 (EST)*

3.  Rename biosql-ora to biosqldb-ora for consistency with the other
    schema versions *Done. --[Hilmar](http://lappland.io) 20:31, 21
    February 2008 (EST)*
4.  Regenerate HTML documentation from schema DDL (using sqlt) *Doesn't
    work, sqlt seems to be broken at present.
    --[Hilmar](http://lappland.io) 21:11, 21 February 2008 (EST)*
5.  Update Changes file. *Done. --[Hilmar](http://lappland.io)
    23:41, 22 February 2008 (EST)*
6.  Update documentation in the repository. *Done, for
    [Biopython](https://github.com/biosql/biosql/tree/master/doc/biopython)
    (see
    [PDF](https://github.com/biosql/biosql/blob/master/doc/biopython/python_biosql_basic.pdf))
    and
    [BioJava/Oracle](https://github.com/biosql/biosql/blob/master/doc/bj_and_bsql_oracle_howto.htm).
    Unfortunately, realized this not before, but only after branching
    off, so need to merge all changes to the branch.
    --[Hilmar](http://lappland.io) 12:06, 24 February 2008 (EST)*
7.  Create biosql-release-1-0 branch. *Done.
    --[Hilmar](http://lappland.io) 23:43, 22 February 2008 (EST)*
8.  Remove from biosql-release-1-0 branch all schema modules or versions
    and all scripts that aren't release-ready yet, or are not yet or no
    longer supported. *Done. --[Hilmar](http://lappland.io) 23:43,
    22 February 2008 (EST)*
    -   This includes the following:
        -   phylodb module DDLs
        -   phylodb ERD
        -   phy\* scripts (depend on phylodb, and not up-to-date)
        -   load\_itis\_taxonomy.pl, tree-precompute.pl scripts (depend
            on phylodb, and not up-to-date)
        -   phylodb-topo-queries.sql (depends on phylodb)
    -   *Can the HSQLDB version be tested by anyone for syntactic
        correctness and compatibility with a current revision of
        HSQLDB?*
